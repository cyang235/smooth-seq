Smooth-seq Data Analysis Pipeline
===========

Introduction
------
We developed a novel third-generation sequencing platform-based single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) method named Smooth-seq (single-molecule real-time sequencing of long fragments amplified via transposon insertion). 
This is an pipeline for Smooth-seq data analysis.
